SparseXML: Simple, tiny and no-functional, but useful parser framework for XML

Abstract: SparseXML is not XML parser library that is just for explorer of XML.
For tiny computers like arduino(atmega), it is difficult to use general parser
library(libxml) because of its tiny hardware resource. Therefore there are some
tiny implementation of Streaming API. However they can not treat XML correctly.
And they provide mainly halfway. Thus SparseXML is developed. SparseXML is a 
explorer program it simply reads XML and occurs event at each elements of XML.

 Using SparseXML, you can develop your own tiny XML parser more easily.
SparseXML provides enough benefits to many scnenes of parsing XML on tiny
computer.

Usage: Look inside test code. it's totally simple, make explorer, register 
functions, feed xml to explorer, occurs events and finally destroy explorer.
That's it.
